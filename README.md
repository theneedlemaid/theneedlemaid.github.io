### Welcome to The NeedleMaid

Hailing from the foothills of the Himalayas in Darjeeling, India, we are the creators of fine fabric merchandise.
We believe in sustainability and going zero-waste on our products with eco-friendly deliveries and a sense of giving back to the community.

This is an attempt to open-source our site as we build along our permanent address on the web.
